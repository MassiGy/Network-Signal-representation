The idea behind this small project is to represent the diffrent signals that we've seen in 
the networking course. 


We have a set of signals, and the main goal is to be able to accept a binary representation 
of a received signal and an encoding then generate the diagram related to that signal.


To be simple, I've decided to just accept the signal with an  prompt call to the user, and 
then process the binary encoding using the chosed encoding to output to a file the proper 
signal.
