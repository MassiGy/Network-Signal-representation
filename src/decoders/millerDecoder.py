        @description millerDecoderUsingPloting 

        This function will take the binary code and use ploting lib to draw its
        signal signature to the end user's screen

        This signal will be drawn following the miller schema, where a 1 is
        represented by a change in the signal voltage (go from one pole to the
        other) during the following clock cycle, and a 0 is represented by an
        absence of transition. If the previous spike was also a 0 then we
        change the voltage before the next clock cycle.
